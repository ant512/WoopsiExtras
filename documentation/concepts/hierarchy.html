	<h1>The Woopsi Hierarchy</h1>
	<p>Before we start putting a GUI together, we need to establish some of the basic concepts that Woopsi uses to describe an interface. First of all, everything visible on the screen is a “gadget”. A gadget is an object that contains basic functionality for drawing lines and rectangles, and it describes a rectangular portion of the screen. Gadgets can contain other gadgets, and so they can themselves be children of other gadgets.</p>

	<p>Gadgets form the lowest level of the Woopsi hierarchy. Gadgets are contained within windows (which are themselves a form of gadget). Windows are rectangular regions of the screen that can be dragged around, and that provide a surface for other gadgets to reside in.</p>

	<p>Above windows are “screens” (another gagdet type). Screens were a concept introduced by the Commodore Amiga’s GUI, “Workbench”, and summarily ignored ever since. The closest modern approximation is Linux’s multiple desktop system or OSX' "Spaces". A screen provides a workspace to which windows can be added. Multiple screens can be added to Woopsi, and clicking the “depth” gadget in the top-right of the screen cycles through them.</p>
