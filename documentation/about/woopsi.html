	<h1>About Woopsi - What is Woopsi?</h1>
	<p>Woopsi is a BSD-licenced windowing system for the Nintendo DS, written in C++. The aim of the project is to create a simple windowing system that programmers can use for their applications, decreasing the tedious amount of GUI code that people have to write.</p>

	<p>The system itself is loosely based on the Commodore Amiga’s “Intuition” windowing system. Everything in the system is treated as a “gadget” (in the same way that Windows treats everything as a sub-class of a window), everything takes place within a “screen” environment, and the look-and-feel of the system intentionally resembles the old Amiga system.</p>

	<p>The windowing system is *not* intended to be a complete desktop environment. It is *not* going to be a DS version of GNOME, KDE or Windows Explorer. It will simply provide a system for rapidly building window and gadget-based interfaces.</p>
